        <h3>Giving concessions</h3>
        <p>
          Gonzaga over the years has acknowledged the need for change and has
          even combated this with programs such as their installation of solar
          panels atop Cantwell Reusch. Gonzaga has also supported clubs such as
          Eagles for Water and the Sustainability Club. However, there is still
          many gaping issues they have yet to address, but luckily we have
          solutions.

        <h2>Light Sensors</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever noticed how despite most classrooms having very large
          windows, overflowing with natural light, the lights are still on? This
          is a common issue at Gonzaga, and it is one of the many reasons why we
          are consuming so much power. A solution to this we propose is the
          installation of light sensors. These sensors would be able to detect
          the amount of light in a room and activate the light according the
          need.
